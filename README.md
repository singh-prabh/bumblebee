# Bumblebee

## Introduction
Bumblebee is an overly ambitious task manager and invoice generator that is open source and cross platform capable. It's meant to be a working demo of a real full stack application that goes beyond the traditional "todo" list demo that can be found for each individual platform. 
 

## Design
I've found that being a developer doesn't exclude me from being part of the design process. In fact I've found more often that when a developer is involved during the design stage then the entire project is built faster and with less revisions needed to fix those random issues that pop up when translating a design to code. Being part of the design process allows developers to define the entire system around how a user would interact with the application before a single line of code is written. 


### MindMap

*Initial idea node for bumblebee*

Most of the time a new project is started with a simple idea, or even statement regarding the goal of the application. I like to use [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) for creating a mind map that can later be used to create the flowchart. This part is usually a quick process, normally just used to get the basic idea down so I can move into the flowchart part with specific layouts already in mind.
